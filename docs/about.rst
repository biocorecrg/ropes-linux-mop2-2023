============

.. 
        Trainees will work in a dedicated Linux environment.


.. _home-page-learning:

Learning objectives
============

* Learn the basics of command-line Linux
* Locate and fetch Docker/Singularity images from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Docker/Singularity container from the command line.
* Understand the components of Nextflow pipeline
* Run a Nextflow pipeline using your own data and tuning it with different parameters
* Write a simple Nextflow pipeline.
* Understand the basics of direct RNA sequencing with Nanopore
* Run the different pipelines in Master Of Pores 2 suite. 

Prerequisite / technical requirements
============


Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.
Knowledge of containers is not mandatory. The course materials is online in the dedicated GitHub page for self-learning.


Those who follow the course should be able to use a command-line/screen-oriented text editor (such as nano or vi/vim, which are already available in the server) or to be able to use an editor able to connect remotely. For sake of information, below the basics of `nano <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Basics_Guide>`_

Having a `GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`_ is recommended.
