Linux is an open-source operating system that was developed in the 1990s by `Linus Torvalds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds>`__. Unlike other popular operating systems like Windows and MacOS, Linux is free to download, use, and distribute.

One of the most distinctive features of Linux is that it is highly customizable. Users can choose from a wide variety of "distributions" (or "distros") of Linux, each with its own unique set of pre-installed software and user interface. Some popular distros include `Ubuntu <https://ubuntu.com/>`__, `Debian <https://www.debian.org/>`__, and `Fedora <https://fedoraproject.org/>`__.

Linux is known for being incredibly stable and secure. It is also highly efficient, which means it can run well even on older or less powerful hardware. This has made Linux a popular choice for servers and other industrial applications.

Because it is **open-source**, Linux has a large and active community of developers who are constantly working to improve the operating system. This means that there are always new updates and features being added to Linux, and users can be confident that their operating system is always up-to-date and secure.

Linux is a is widely used in **bioinformatics** due to its ability to handle large data sets and complex computational tasks. Bioinformaticians use Linux to analyze DNA sequences, study gene expression, and develop computational models of biological systems.

One of the most important features of Linux for bioinformatics is its support for powerful command-line tools. These tools allow bioinformaticians to perform complex data processing and analysis tasks with ease. In addition, Linux provides a rich array of programming languages and libraries that are essential for bioinformatics research, such as **Python**, **Java**, **Perl**, **C** and **C++**.

One of the key advantages of Linux for bioinformatics is its ability to run on a wide range of hardware, from powerful servers to small embedded devices. This makes it possible to run bioinformatics analyses on a variety of different systems, including **high-performance computing clusters**, **cloud-based platforms**, and **personal computers**.

Another advantage of Linux for bioinformatics is its strong focus on security and reliability. Because Linux is **open source**, the community is constantly working to improve the operating system and fix any security vulnerabilities that are discovered. This makes Linux a trusted platform for sensitive bioinformatics data.
